            We have full Public Liability Insurance of £5m. Please contact us if
            you require further information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are DBS checked. Please contact us if you require further
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use professional EC compliant water-based face paints, which are
            designed specifically for use on the face and body such as Diamond
            FX, Tag, Fusion, Super Star, etc. All paints, glitters and make-up
            are safe; however in very rare instances may cause a reaction and
            undertaking this application is at your own risk. Please contact us
            if you require further information.
          </p>
          <p>We will only paint those who are happy to be painted.</p>
          <p>
            We will not paint faces of children under the age of 2. Between 2
            and 3 we may paint something small or on their arm but this is at
            the discretion of the artist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children under 16 will need permission to be painted from their
            parent, carer or party host.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parents are responsible for their children at all times. For safety
            reasons, please don’t allow children to play in the area being
            painted in or to touch the equipment. Any damages will be charged to
            the client.
          </p>
          <h2 className="font-bold text-xl mt-4">Hygiene</h2>
          <p>
            Any person with cold sores, conjunctivitis, open wounds or any
            apparent skin/eye infection or disease will not be painted. The face
            painter’s decision is final.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the unlikely event of a skin reaction
            (itching/swelling/discomfort), face paint should be washed off
            immediately with water and a soft cloth. Baby wipes are not used as
            this may aggravate the skin further.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sponges and brushes are washed thoroughly with soap between events.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use 1 sponge per child and brushes are cleaned between clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Face paints should be removed with a face cloth and warm, soapy
            water. Some stronger colours may ‘linger’ a little. Do not scrub,
            but leave until the morning and wash again, or apply baby oil with
            cotton wool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any face paint on clothing should wash out with normal detergent. We
            cannot be held responsible for any stains that will not come out.
          </p>

            patience.
